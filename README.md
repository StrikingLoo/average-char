# SIMD Script

This was a small practice script I wrote before a test.

These are SSE exercises I wrote, and thougt they were cool enough to appear on my github.

The 'average_byte' function uses SIMD instructions to find the average value given a stream of bytes.

The 'replace_byte' function replaces all instances of a given byte value with a different value.
